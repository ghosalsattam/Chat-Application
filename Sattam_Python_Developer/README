To run the pipeline; first open two different terminals(if you are running both server and client on same system). First run the server.py
file on one terminal.
Then run the client.py file on the other terminal. As soon as the client connects, a message of client connection is shown in server. To 
start conversation, type a message from client side first. The server receives the message.
Similarly other clients can also connect,(only when the server is free and waiting for clients messages).
The program is handled through threading. So the clients can communicate independently of server's state(typing/not typing).

The message.txt file contain the name of the Users. You can change the usernames to as per your convenience.

In the client-server communication, RSA encryption is used.

To change the device/port, change the PORT and IP variable in the server and client codes.
